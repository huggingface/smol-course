# Automatic Benchmarks

Automatic benchmarks serve as standardized tools for evaluating language models across different tasks and capabilities. While they provide a useful starting point for understanding model performance, it's important to recognize that they represent only one piece of a comprehensive evaluation strategy.

## Understanding Automatic Benchmarks

Automatic benchmarks typically consist of curated datasets with predefined tasks and evaluation metrics. These benchmarks aim to assess various aspects of model capability, from basic language understanding to complex reasoning. The key advantage of using automatic benchmarks is their standardization - they allow for consistent comparison across different models and provide reproducible results.

However, it's crucial to understand that benchmark performance doesn't always translate directly to real-world effectiveness. A model that excels at academic benchmarks may still struggle with specific domain applications or practical use cases.

## Major Benchmarks and Their Focus

### General Knowledge: MMLU

[**Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU)**](https://huggingface.co/papers/2009.03300) tests knowledge across 57 subjects, from STEM to humanities. It evaluates:
- Abstract reasoning
- Historical knowledge
- Scientific understanding
- Professional expertise

Example MMLU question:

```
Question: Which of the following is not a component of the circulatory system?
A) Heart
B) Blood vessels
C) Lymph nodes
D) Blood

Answer: C
```

### Truthfulness: TruthfulQA

[**TruthfulQA**](https://huggingface.co/papers/2109.07958) evaluates a model's tendency to reproduce common misconceptions. It tests whether models:
- Avoid generating false information
- Resist repeating common myths
- Provide accurate factual responses

### Reasoning: BBH and GSM8K

[**Big Bench Hard (BBH)**](https://huggingface.co/papers/2206.04615) focuses on complex reasoning tasks that require:
- Multi-step logical thinking
- Planning and strategy
- Abstract pattern recognition

**GSM8K** specifically targets mathematical problem-solving with grade-school math word problems:


```
Question: Sarah has 5 apples. She buys 3 more apples at the store, 
then gives 2 apples to her friend. How many apples does Sarah have now?

Answer: 5 + 3 - 2 = 6 apples
```

### Language Understanding: WinoGrande

[**WinoGrande**](https://huggingface.co/papers/1907.10641) tests common sense reasoning through pronoun disambiguation:
```
The trophy doesn't fit in the suitcase because it is too large.
What is too large? 
A) The trophy
B) The suitcase

Answer: A
```

## Using LightEval for Benchmarking

LightEval tasks follow a specific format:
```
{suite}|{task}|{num_few_shot}|{auto_reduce}
```

- suite: The benchmark suite (e.g., 'mmlu', 'truthfulqa')
- task: Specific task within the suite (e.g., 'abstract_algebra')
- num_few_shot: Number of examples to include in prompt (0 for zero-shot)
- auto_reduce: Whether to automatically reduce few-shot examples if prompt is too long (0 or 1)

### Complete Evaluation Example

Here's a comprehensive example of running multiple benchmarks using the LightEval CLI with [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/) backend:

#### Basic CLI Usage

For a quick evaluation on a single benchmark:

```bash
# Basic evaluation with vLLM backend
lighteval vllm \
    "model_name=HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct,dtype=float16" \
    "leaderboard|truthfulqa:mc|0|0"
```

#### Using Configuration Files

For advanced configurations, create a YAML config file as recommended in the [LightEval vLLM documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/lighteval/en/use-vllm-as-backend):

```yaml
# vllm_config.yaml
model_parameters:
    model_name: "HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct"
    revision: "main"
    dtype: "float16"
    tensor_parallel_size: 1
    data_parallel_size: 1
    pipeline_parallel_size: 1
    gpu_memory_utilization: 0.9
    max_model_length: 2048
    swap_space: 4
    seed: 1
    trust_remote_code: True
    use_chat_template: True
    add_special_tokens: True
    multichoice_continuations_start_space: True
    pairwise_tokenization: True
    subfolder: null
    generation_parameters:
      presence_penalty: 0.0
      repetition_penalty: 1.0
      frequency_penalty: 0.0
      temperature: 1.0
      top_k: 50
      min_p: 0.0
      top_p: 1.0
      seed: 42
      stop_tokens: null
      max_new_tokens: 1024
      min_new_tokens: 0
```

Then run evaluations using the config file:

```bash
# Using config file for evaluation
lighteval vllm "vllm_config.yaml" "leaderboard|mmlu:abstract_algebra|5|1"
lighteval vllm "vllm_config.yaml" "leaderboard|truthfulqa:mc|0|0"
lighteval vllm "vllm_config.yaml" "leaderboard|gsm8k|5|1"
```

## Interpreting Results

When analyzing benchmark results, consider:

1. Relative Performance - How does your model compare to similar-sized models?
2. Task Distribution - Are there patterns in which types of tasks the model handles well?
3. Error Analysis - What kinds of mistakes is the model making?
4. Variance - How consistent is performance across different examples?

## Limitations and Considerations

### Why Benchmarks Aren't Everything

1. Training Data Contamination - Models may have seen benchmark questions during training
2. Task Specificity - Benchmarks test specific formats that may not match your use case
3. Gaming Metrics - Models can be optimized for benchmarks at the expense of general capability
4. Cultural and Domain Bias - Many benchmarks have Western/English-centric perspectives

### Alternative Evaluation Approaches

Beyond standard benchmarks, consider:

- LLM-as-Judge: Using stronger models to evaluate outputs
- Human Evaluation: Direct assessment by domain experts
- Application-Specific Metrics: Custom measurements for your use case
- Online Evaluation: A/B testing in production environments

## Best Practices for Benchmark Evaluation

1. Use Multiple Benchmarks - No single benchmark captures all capabilities
2. Consider Few-Shot Settings - Test both zero-shot and few-shot performance
3. Document Evaluation Settings - Record all parameters for reproducibility
4. Compare Against Baselines - Use reference models for context
5. Look Beyond Averages - Examine performance distribution and outliers

## Practical Tips

### Optimizing Evaluation Speed

For quick iterations and testing, you can limit the evaluation scope:

```bash
# Quick evaluation on a subset of samples
lighteval vllm \
    "model_name=HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct,dtype=float16,gpu_memory_utilization=0.9" \
    "leaderboard|truthfulqa:mc|0|0" \
    --max_samples 50

# For faster evaluation with multiple GPUs
lighteval vllm \
    "model_name=HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct,dtype=float16,data_parallel_size=4" \
    "leaderboard|mmlu:abstract_algebra|5|1"
```

### Selecting Relevant Benchmarks

For different domains, prioritize different benchmarks:

- Scientific Applications: MMLU science subjects, reasoning benchmarks
- Educational Tools: GSM8K, reading comprehension, truthfulness
- General Assistants: Broad MMLU coverage, conversation benchmarks
- Code Generation: HumanEval, MBPP (not covered here)


## Next Steps

Now that you understand automatic benchmarks, you're ready to:
- Create custom evaluation tasks specific to your domain
- Implement specialized metrics for your use case
- Build comprehensive evaluation pipelines

Remember: benchmarks are tools for understanding, not targets for optimization. Use them wisely to guide model development while keeping your actual use case in mind.
