# Using Pretrained VLMs

Visual Language Models (VLMs) process **images and text simultaneously**, enabling advanced tasks like generating captions, answering visual questions, or reasoning across modalities. In this section, we focus on **how VLMs work and how to use them practically**.

## Architecture Overview

![VLM Architecture](https://huggingface.co/datasets/smol-course/images/resolve/main/VLM_Architecture.png)

VLMs combine image-processing and text-generation components for a unified multimodal understanding. The main elements are:

- **Image/Vision Encoder**: Converts images into compact numerical representations. Examples: CLIP, SigLIP.  
- **Embedding Projector**: Aligns image features with text embeddings (often a small MLP or linear layer fine-tuned for the multimodal task).
- **Multimodal Projector / Fusion Module**: Fuses and enhances connections between visual and textual representations. This step goes beyond alignment, enabling rich cross-modal interaction.representations.
- **Text Decoder**: Generates text (or other outputs) from the fused multimodal representations.

Most VLMs leverage **pretrained image encoders and text decoders**, then fine-tune on paired image-text datasets for efficient training and generalization.

## Practical Usage

VLMs can be applied to tasks such as:

- **Image Captioning:** generating descriptions for images
- **Visual Question Answering (VQA):** answering questions about an image
- **Cross-Modal Retrieval:** matching images with text and vice versa
- **Creative Applications:** design, art generation, multimedia content

High-quality paired datasets are key, and ðŸ¤— transformers provide pretrained models and streamlined fine-tuning workflows.

### Chat Format

Many VLMs support **chat-like interactions**, with messages structured as:

1. **System message:** sets context: `"You are an assistant analyzing visual data."`  
2. **User queries:** combine text and images.  
3. **Assistant responses:** generated text based on multimodal analysis.  

Example:

```json
[
  {
    "role": "system",
    "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "You are a VLM specialized in charts."}]
  },
  {
    "role": "user",
    "content": [
      {"type": "image", "image": "<image_data>"},
      {"type": "text", "text": "What is the highest value in this chart?"}
    ]
  },
  {
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "42"}]
  }
]
```

VLMs can also handle **multiple images or video frames** as input by passing sequences of images through the same chat template.

## Using a VLM via pipeline

As we saw in [Unit 1](../unit1/2), the easiest way to use a VLM is through the ðŸ¤— `pipeline` abstraction:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Initialize the pipeline with a VLM
pipe = pipeline("image-text-to-text", "HuggingFaceTB/SmolVLM2-2.2B-Instruct", device_map="auto")

# Define your conversation with an image
messages = [
     {
         "role": "user",
         "content": [
             {
                 "type": "image",
                 "image": "https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/bee.jpg",
             },
             {"type": "text", "text": "Describe this image."},
         ],
     }
 ]

outputs = pipe(text=messages, max_new_tokens=60, return_full_text=False)

# Generate response - pipeline handles multimodal inputs automatically
response = pipe(messages, max_new_tokens=128, temperature=0.7)

print(response[0]['generated_text'][-1]['content'])  # Print the model's description
```

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>

```text
The image depicts a close-up view of a flower garden, specifically focusing on a pink flower. The flower is the central subject of the image, and it is a prominent feature due to its vibrant color and intricate details. The flower has a circular shape, with petals that are slightly curled and have a gradient from light to dark pink. The petals are arranged symmetrically around the central pistil, which is visible in the center of the flower. The pistil is a small, yellow structure that is surrounded by a cluster of stamens, which are visible as small, yellow structures. The flower also has a small, black

## Using a VLM via Transformers (Full Control)

For advanced use, you can access a VLM directly via ðŸ¤— Transformers, giving you **full control over each component**.  
To reduce memory usage and speed up inference, we can apply **4-bit quantization** using `bitsandbytes`.  

Unlike standard LLM usage, VLMs require a **processor** instead of just a tokenizer. The processor handles both **text tokenization** and **image preprocessing**, streamlining the workflow for multimodal inputs.

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoProcessor, AutoModelForImageTextToText, BitsAndBytesConfig
from transformers.image_utils import load_image

device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"

# Quantization for efficiency
quant_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(load_in_4bit=True)
model_name = "HuggingFaceTB/SmolVLM2-2.2B-Instruct"
model = AutoModelForImageTextToText.from_pretrained(model_name, quantization_config=quant_config).to(device)
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_name)
```

### Example: Describe an Image

We can use the **chat template** to describe images. Each image is represented as `{"type": "image"}` in the message, and the actual image data is passed to the processor via the `images` argument. The processor handles both text and visual inputs seamlessly.


```python
# Load image
image_url = "https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/bee.jpg"
image = load_image(image_url)

# Create input messages
messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "image"},
            {"type": "text", "text": "Can you describe the image?"}
        ]
    },
]

# Prepare inputs
prompt = processor.apply_chat_template(messages, add_generation_prompt=True)
inputs = processor(text=prompt, images=[image], return_tensors="pt")
inputs = inputs.to(device)

# Generate outputs
generated_ids = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=500)
generated_texts = processor.batch_decode(
    generated_ids,
    skip_special_tokens=True,
)[0]

# Extract only the assistant response
assistant_response = generated_texts.split("Assistant:")[-1].strip()

print(assistant_response)
```

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>

```text
The image is of a bee on a flower.
```

</details>

The processor combines the text and image inputs, so the model can generate coherent multimodal outputs.

> [!TIP]
> Similar templates can handle multiple images, OCR tasks, or even video frames, making VLMs highly versatile.
