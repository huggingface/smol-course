We can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\nA(1, 1) = \\sqrt{3} |AB|^2\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the left side, we get:\n\n\\[\n|AB| = \\sqrt{3} |1|\n\\]\n\nLet's pause and consider what we know so far. We have found \\( |AB| = \\sqrt{3} |1| \\). Now, let's solve for \\( |AB| \\).\n\nTo find \\( |AB| \\), we calculate the length of one side:\n\n\\[\nAB = 1\n\\]\n\nNow, we need the width of the triangle. It should be the opposite side \\( |AB| \\):\n\n\\[\n|AB| = 1 - |AD|\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( |AD| = 1 + \\sqrt{3} \\).\n\nSubstituting these values into our equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n|AB| = \\sqrt{3} |1| - \\sqrt{3} |AD| = \\sqrt{3} \\times 1 + \\sqrt{3} = \\sqrt{3} |AD|\n\\]\n\nLet's pause and review what we've done. We've found \\( |AB| = \\sqrt{3} |1| \\) and \\( |AD| = 1 + \\sqrt{3} \\), allowing us to set up the equation for the width. Finally, we calculate the width:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{3} |AD| = 1 + \\sqrt{3} = \\sqrt{3} |AD|\n\\]\n\nNow, let's find the area:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} |AB|^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} |AD|^2 = \\frac{3}{2} |1|^2 = 1\n\\]\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is \\( \\boxed{1} \\) square unit. This process shows how each step connects to previous ones, ensuring a clear understanding of the problem.\n####  1,000 square units\nWe need to find the area of a triangle with vertices at \\( A(2, 2) \\) and \\( B(4, 4) \\).\n\nFirst, let's find the area of the triangle by cross-multiplying:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} |AB|^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} |AC|^2\n\\]\n\nNext, we use the equation \\( |AB| = |AC| \\), which allows us to set up the equation for the width:\n\n\\[\n|AB| = |AC| + \\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( |AB| = 2 \\) and \\( |AC| = 4 \\), we get:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} |AB| + \\sqrt{3} = 1 + \\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\n\\[\n|\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}| + \\sqrt{3} = 4\n\\]\n\nNow, let's subtract 4 from both sides to isolate the square root:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 4 - \\frac{4}{2}\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 2 gives:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 3\n\\]\n\nLet's pause and review this solution. We find \\( |\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} | = 3 \\). Therefore, the square root of 3 is approximately 3.00.\n\nFinally, the area is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3.00}\n\\]\n\n#### 3.00 square units\nWe need to find the area of a triangle with vertices at \\( A(2, 2) \\) and \\( B(4, 4) \\).\n\nFirst, we find the area of the triangle by perpendicular bisector calculation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} |AB| = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} |AC| = \\frac{3}{2} |1| = 1\n\\]\n\nNext, we use the perpendicular bisector to find the area of the triangle:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} |AB| = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} |AC| = \\frac{3}{2} |1| = 1\n\\]\n\nNow, the area of the triangle is \\( \\boxed{1} \\).\n\n#### 1 square unit\nTo find the area of a triangle with vertices at \\((0, 0)\\), we'll use the formula for the area of a triangle with vertices at \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\), where \\( x_1 \\) and \\( y_1 \\) are distances from the vertices to the x-y-plane and \\( x_2 \\) and \\( y_2 \\) are distances from the vertices to the x and y-y-planes respectively, we'll set \\( x_1 = y_1 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} |AB| = |AC| = 1\n\\]\n\nNow, let's find the area of the triangle:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} |AB|^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} |AC|^2\n\\]\n\nLet's set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n|AB|^2 = |AC|^2 + |AB|^2\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the left side:\n\n\\[\n|AB|^2 = 3|AC|^2\n\\]\n\nLet's expand the right side:\n\n\\[\n|AC|^2 = 2|x_1 - x_2|^2 + 1^2 = 2 |x_1 - 4|^2 + 1^2\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this, we have:\n\n\\[\n|AB|^2 = 2|x_1 - 4|^2 + 1^2 = 2 |x_1 - 4|\n\\]\n\nLet's divide both sides by 2 to solve for the area:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} |AB| = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} |x_1 - 4|\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by \\( |x_1 - 4| \\), we find:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} |x_1 - 4| = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} |1 - 4|\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by \\( |x_1 - 4| \\), we find:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} |x_1 - 4| = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} |1 - 4|\n\\]\n\nSetting each side equal gives:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = |1 - 4|\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{3} = |1 - 4|\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by \\( |x_1 - 4| \\), we find:\n\n\\[\nx_1 - 4 = 1\n\\]\n\n#### 1 square unit\nThe area of a triangle with vertices at \\((0, 0)\\) and \\((x_1, y_1)\\), where \\( x_1 \\) is distance from vertex \\((x_1, y_1)\\), and \\( y_1 \\) is distance from vertex \\((x_1, y_1)\\), is:\n\n\\[\ny_1 = \\frac{1}{2} |x_1 - 4|\n\\]\n\nNow, let's find the area of a triangle with vertices at \\((0, 0)\\) and \\((x_1, y_1)\\), where \\( x_1 \\) is distance from vertex \\((x_1, y_1)\\) to the x-y-plane and \\( y_1 \\) is distance from vertex \\((x_1, y_1)\\) to the x-y-plane respectively.\n\nFirst, let's set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n(0, 0) = \\frac{1}{2} |x_1 - 4|\n\\]\n\nNext, let's find the distance from vertex \\((x_1, y_1)\\) to the x-y-plane:\n\n\\[\nx_1 = \\frac{y_1}{2}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need the area of the triangle:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} |x_1 - 4| = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} |0 - 4| = \\frac{-4}{2} = -2\n\\]\n\nLet's pause and review this solution.
