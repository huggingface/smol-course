LoRA is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique that:\n- Freezes the pre-trained model weights\n- Adds small trainable rank decomposition matrices to attention layers\n- Typically reduces trainable parameters by ~90%\n- Maintains model performance while being memory efficient\n\nWe'll cover:\n1. Setup development environment and LoRA configuration\n2. Create and prepare the dataset for adapter training\n3. Fine-tune using `trl` and `SFTTrainer` with LoRA adapters\n4. Test the model and merge adapters (optional)\n","metadata":{"id":"z-6LLOPZouLg"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1. Setup development environment\n\nOur first step is to install Hugging Face Libraries and Pyroch, including trl, transformers and datasets. If you haven't heard of trl yet, don't worry.

Fine-tune LLM using `trl` and the `SFTTrainer` with LoRA\n\nThe [SFTTrainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/sft_trainer) from `trl` provides integration with LoRA adapters through the [PEFT](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/en/index) library. Key advantages of this setup include:\n\n1. **Memory Efficiency**: \n   - Only adapter parameters are stored in GPU memory\n   - Base model weights remain frozen and can be loaded in lower precision\n   - Enables fine-tuning of large models on consumer GPUs\n\n2. **Training Features**:\n   - Native PEFT/LoRA integration with minimal setup\n   - Support for QLoRA (Quantized LoRA) for even better memory efficiency\n\n3. **Adapter Management**:\n   - Adapter weight saving during checkpoints\n   - Features to merge adapters back into base model\n\nWe'll use LoRA in our example, which combines LoRA with 4-bit quantization to further reduce memory usage without sacrificing performance. The setup requires just a few configuration steps:\n1. Define the LoRA configuration (rank, alpha, dropout)\n2. Create the SFTTrainer with PEFT config\n3.
