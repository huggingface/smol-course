In this case study, we demonstrate how to use DPO to align a language model to a user-provided policy further automating the process via synthetic data generation and LLM-as-judge evaluation.

We go over a Case Study for Acme Inc., a company dedicated to democratizing access to computer science education for K-12 students. Acme Inc. is in the process of creating a chatbot named smolK-12, a small open source LLM, specifically designed for K-12 students.

We’ll explore how to align a language model with Acme Inc.’s policy to ensure its LLM-powered applications are safe and appropriate for K-12 students.
